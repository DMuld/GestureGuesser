Things to Note:
When starting the program it will take a second for the Webcam view to show up. 
To start the GUI, click the webcam portal and press 'u' on the keyboard. This will present the GUI and allow users to change the mapping between gestures and commands. 
Once you close the GUI, the vision software will start working again. 
To end the program click the vision software and press 'q'.

Also, if you look at the top right of the vision page, it shows some built-in commands that we could possibly use if the finger tracker is too difficult to implement.
